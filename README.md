## ⚡ Why This Exists

Many Bluetti charging stations display time using a non-standard **decimal format** — for example, `14.8` instead of clearly stating **14 hours and 48 minutes**. This can be confusing or misleading, especially when estimating charge or runtime.

This tool was created to help users **instantly convert** such decimal time displays into **human-readable values**, like proper hours and minutes — right from your browser, with no setup or extra steps.

If your power station says `2.1`, this tool will tell you: ✅ Approximate: 2 hour(s) 6 minute(s)
